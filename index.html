            <h2>What's Clio&Erato?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="red-bold">
              The <i>Clio&Erato</i> magazine takes its name from two Greek muses. In ancient Greek religion and mythology, the Muses are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts.
              They were considered the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, lyric songs, and myths. Clio is the muse of history and Erato is the muse of lyric poetry, in order to represent the magazine's central theme:
              <i>Women's (lyric) poetry across history</i>. <br><br> 
              First of all...<i>What's poetry?</i><br>
              Poetry, also called verse, is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic qualities of language − such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre − to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, a prosaic ostensible meaning. A poem is a literary composition, written by a poet, using this principle.<br><br>
              Lyric poetry began as a fixture of ancient Greece, classified against other categories of poetry at the time of classical antiquity, such as dramas and epic poems. The lyric was far shorter, distinguished also by its focus on the poet’s state of mind and personal themes rather than narrative arc.<br><br>
              Three issues have been chosen to represent lyric poetry, in a chronological order, through centuries:
              the ancient poetry, the romantic poetry and the contemporary poetry. <br><br> A famous poetess is proposed for each issue:
              <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sappho-Greek-poet">Sappho</a> represents the Ancient Era of poetry; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emily-Dickinson">Emily Dickinson</a> represents the romantic poetry of the nineteenth century; and <a href="https://rupikaur.com/">Rupi Kaur</a> represents the contemporary poetry of the twenty-first century.
              You can now read three poems of each poetess. <br><br>
              The word “poetry” itself comes from the Greek word <i>poieo</i> meaning “I create”. Poetry is used to convey love, lyrics, anger, hate, magic… poetry is a method of creation and manifestation, a method of memory and preservation.<br><br>
              This magazine encompasses the meaningful creations of some important women for their times' poetry.<br><br>

                  <p>Sappho is not only one of the few women poets we know of from antiquity, but also is one of the greatest lyric poets from any age. Sappho’s verses speak from one individual to another, simply and directly about the difficulties of love.</p>
