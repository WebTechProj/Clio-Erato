        <h2>Website structure</h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The website have been developed using HTML for implementing the structure of the web pages, CSS for the visualization features and JavaScript for the interactive functions.<br><br>
          The <span id="b">main pages</span>, each with its own HTML file, are Home, Issues, Documentation and Project. They all have in common the navigation bar and the footer, which have been taken from some predefined <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> models and adapted to the project's purposes.<br><br>
          The section <a href="index.html">Home</a> (index.html) contains a carousel giving access to the issues, an introduction about the magazine and its scope and a short presentation of the poets included in the issues.<br><br>
          The section <a href="issues.html">Issues</a> (issues.html) contains an index, which allows to reach the poets and the specific poems selected for the project, an introduction to explain the chosen issues and their subdivision, and finally the issues, in chronological order, each of which consists of a presentation of the poets and a grid to choose between the poems.<br><br>
          The section <a href="documentation.html">Documentation</a> (documentation.html) contains information about the website structure, the texts (selection of poems and metadata) and the typographical styles.<br><br>
          The section <a href="project.html">Project</a> (project.html) contains information about the purpose of the project and its team, and a disclaimer.<br><br>
          The <span id="b">navigation bar</span> includes a final icon on the right, in order to allow the user to change theme on the fly, having different types of visualization of the whole website. For more information about the choice of the themes, see the paragraph <a href="#typo">Typographical styles</a>. The footer, on the other hand, offers the possibility to reach the specific issues and the poems grouped by authors' names.<br><br>
          An additional HTML file (<a href="texts.html">texts.html</a>) has been created in order to visualize the poems and the related metadata. See the paragraph <a href="#textsMetadata">Texts metadata</a> for a short analysis of the file "texts.html".<br>The typographical styles have been developed using a different CSS file for each theme.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h2 class="section-title" id="textsMetadata">Texts metadata</h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The web page <a href="texts.html">texts.html</a> has been developed to visualize the single poems and the related metadata. A Metadata Table is always visible on the left of the main section of the page, from which the user can select the poem and then select the metadata to highlight in the text.<br><br>
          During the <span id="b">choice of the poem</span>, the user has to select an author's name and discover a list of buttons, representing the poems of the chosen author. If the user clicks on the title of a chosen poem, its text will appear to the right of the Metadata Table, in English language.<br><br>
          The whole website has been developed in English <span id="b">language</span>, so all the poems are firstly displayed in English, but there's a button above the text, which proposes to the user to show the second language of the poem. The second language depends on the author, indeed Sappho's poems can also be visualized in Greek language, since it's the original language of the texts, while Kaur's and Dickinson's poems can be showed also in Italian language, since English is already the original language of the texts.<br><br>
          For what concerns the <span id="b">selection of the metadata</span>, five buttons are constantly displayed, allowing the user to highlight the words or expressions in the texts which belong to the selected metadata class. In order to distinguish the classes and visually compare them on the text, each class has been associated with a color, filling also the button of the class' name, to make the association clear.<br><br>
          The <span id="b">five classes</span> represent the recurrent themes which all the poems have, more or less, in common: <span id="b">Self-reference</span>, intended as a reference to the author herself or to a group or community to which the author feels to belong; <span id="b">Generic places</span>, both concrete and abstract; <span id="b">Negatives</span>, including all the words and expressions with negative connotation, related for example to death, suffering, loneliness; <span id="b">Positives</span>, including all the words and expressions with positive connotation, related for example to liveliness, happiness and healing.<br><br>
          The interactivity of the metadata section depends on different <span id="b">JavaScript functions</span>:
          <br>
          <br>
          - functions to show the poems' buttons with the titles when click on the poet's name in the metadata table;
          <br>- functions to show the poems on click of the title button, which are based on the <span id="b">.innerHTML</span> method, in order to replace a specific part of the HTML file, in this case div containing the poems to the right of the Metadata Table. Basically, the text of the poem is inserted in the HTML section. The same method is used to display the poem in the second language;
          <br>- functions to highlight words and expressions in the poems, related to the chosen classes, allowing to highlight all the classes contemporarily and to remove the highlight associated to a class when this latter is clicked again while active;
          <br>- flags to control if the highlight functions are active, and if they are, they stay active even when other functions are called, such as the ones for showing and hiding the second language of the poems: a flag is set true when the corresponding highlighting function is called and set false when the function to remove the corresponding highlight is called.

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo">Typographical styles - Bembo</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The first theme delve into the art of recreating classic typography using the "Bembo" a font with a rich history dating back to the Renaissance. Bembo is not just any font, it's a timeless piece of typography history. Its origins can be traced to the late 15th century, when Francesco Griffo designed a Roman typeface for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius.<br>
          This style known as "Aldine roman", is the basis for the Bembo font we use today. Named after its debut in a 1496 book named "The Aetna" by Pietro Bembo, this font has been cherished for centuries for its classic, readable and graceful appearence. To transport our readers back to this era, we've carefully crafted a CSS style that captures the essence of 1500s typography.<br>
          Specifically, we've chosen a grey old-paper background to evoke the feeling of reading from aged manuscripts. This choice sets the tone for the entire website. In the spirit of 16th century manuscripts, we've highlighted the first capital letter of each paragraph with a bold, reagal red. This classic touch adds visual interest and guides the reader's eye, we've choosen the same color for the header and the footer as well.<br>
          To mimic the monochromtic aesthetic of old prints, we've applied a black and white filter to our content. Central to out design, the Bembo font is used thoughout the website. We've adorned our content with black straight borders, reminencent of the ornamental borders used in Renaissance typography, to deliver an image of elegance. Our content areas, headers and sidebars mantain balanced proportions, creating a pleasent layout.<br>

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo">Typographical styles - Déco</h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The second theme pays homage to the iconic aesthetic of Art Déco movemnet, characterized by bold geometry and luxurious colors.<br>
          Art Déco has been a visual and deisgn movement prominent in the 1920s and 1939s, celebrating glamour, luxury and modernity. It's known for its distincive use of geometric shapes, lavish ornamentation and bold, stylized lettering.<br>
          To bring this essence of Art Déco we've selected three fonts inspired by the iconic typefaces of the era, while the predominant colors are green and gold.<br>
          The website design is also focused on geometric patterns and lines which reminds of Art Deco architecture, these shapes in brders echoes the precision and symmetry of Art Deco design.<br>
          We've applied a sepia filter to our visuals, this filter adds a warm and nostalgia to the images.<br>

        <div class="div-immagini">
        <p class="red-bold">
          The third theme is inspired to 60s Advertisement and Hippie Aesthetic. The 1960s were a time of experimental and eye catching typography. We've carefully curated fonts that pay tribute to this dynamic era, embodying the bold and expressive spirit of 60s advertisement, with its oversized letters and playful curves.<br>
          Our color palette is a kaleidoscope of 60s and hippie influences, as well as advertisement posters of the time. We've chosen a predominant sky blue and light yellow. We go from vibrant oranges and eletric blues to earthy browns.<br>
          The borders are adornerd with groovy circle shapes, the use of circluar imagery is reminiscent of 60s visuals, from psychedelic album covers to peace signs. <br>

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo">Typographical styles - Social2030</h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
         In the last theme, we've offering a sneak peek into the future of social networking. The website gives a vibrant fusion of futuristic aesthetic, striking fonts, fluorescent colors and the familiariy of today's social media giants. It's designed as an Instagram-inspired experience, with elements that mimic the style of Instagram stories and a sleek black background.<br>
         We've adapted a grid layout, similar to Instagram profiles and a dark mode, which is not just futuristic but also easier on the eyes in low-light conditions. Each font choice mantains a consistent presence thoroughout the website, contributing to a cohesive appearence. <br>
