        <h2>Website structure</h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The website have been developed using HTML for implementing the structure of the web pages, CSS for the visualization features and JavaScript for the interactive functions.<br><br>
          The <span id="b">main pages</span>, each with its own HTML file, are Home, Issues, Documentation and Project. They all have in common the navigation bar and the footer, which have been taken from some predefined <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> models and adapted to the project's purposes.<br><br>
          The section <a href="index.html">Home</a> (index.html) contains a carousel giving access to the issues, an introduction about the magazine and its scope and a short presentation of the poets included in the issues.<br><br>
          The section <a href="issues.html">Issues</a> (issues.html) contains an index, which allows to reach the poets and the specific poems selected for the project, an introduction to explain the chosen issues and their subdivision, and finally the issues, in chronological order, each of which consists of a presentation of the poets and a grid to choose between the poems.<br><br>
          The section <a href="documentation.html">Documentation</a> (documentation.html) contains information about the website structure, the texts (selection of poems and metadata) and the typographical styles.<br><br>
          The section <a href="project.html">Project</a> (project.html) contains information about the purpose of the project and its team, and a disclaimer.<br><br>
          The <span id="b">navigation bar</span> includes a final icon on the right, in order to allow the user to change theme on the fly, having different types of visualization of the whole website. For more information about the choice of the themes, see the paragraph <a href="#typo">Typographical styles</a>. The footer, on the other hand, offers the possibility to reach the specific issues and the poems grouped by authors' names.<br><br>
          An additional HTML file (<a href="texts.html">texts.html</a>) has been created in order to visualize the poems and the related metadata. See the paragraph <a href="#textsMetadata">Texts metadata</a> for a short analysis of the file "texts.html".<br>
          <br>The typographical styles have been developed using a different CSS file for each theme.<br>It is possible to switch style (and css file) without refreshing the website, because the function <span id="b">"changeTheme"</span> takes as input the css path (which is associated with each style button) and sets it as value of the Attribute "href" of the Element with the "linkStyle" id.<br> 
          The function also stores the choice of the css file, so it can stay the same even when the user changes web page.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h2 class="section-title" id="textsMetadata">Texts metadata</h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The web page <a href="texts.html">texts.html</a> has been developed to visualize the single poems and the related metadata. A Metadata Table is always visible on the left of the main section of the page, from which the user can select the poem and then select the metadata to highlight in the text.<br><br>
          During the <span id="b">choice of the poem</span>, the user has to select an author's name and discover a list of buttons, representing the poems of the chosen author. If the user clicks on the title of a chosen poem, its text will appear to the right of the Metadata Table, in English language.<br><br>
          The whole website has been developed in English <span id="b">language</span>, so all the poems are firstly displayed in English, but there's a button above the text, which proposes to the user to show the second language of the poem. The second language depends on the author, indeed Sappho's poems can also be visualized in Greek language, since it's the original language of the texts, while Kaur's and Dickinson's poems can be showed also in Italian language, since English is already the original language of the texts.<br><br>
          For what concerns the <span id="b">selection of the metadata</span>, five buttons are constantly displayed, allowing the user to highlight the words or expressions in the texts which belong to the selected metadata class. In order to distinguish the classes and visually compare them on the text, each class has been associated with a color, filling also the button of the class' name, to make the association clear.<br><br>
          The <span id="b">four classes</span> represent the recurrent themes which all the poems have, more or less, in common: <span id="b">Self-reference</span>, intended as a reference to the author herself or to a group or community to which the author feels to belong; <span id="b">Generic places</span>, both concrete and abstract; <span id="b">Negatives</span>, including all the words and expressions with negative connotation, related for example to death, suffering, loneliness; <span id="b">Positives</span>, including all the words and expressions with positive connotation, related for example to liveliness, happiness and healing.<br><br>
          The interactivity of the metadata section depends on different <span id="b">JavaScript functions</span>:
          <br>
          <br>
          - functions to show the poems' buttons with the titles when the user clicks on the poet's name in the metadata table. These are based on the <span id="b">.innerHTML</span> method, which replaces the HTML part related to the Metadata Table, by changing the id of the poems' titles, in order to make them visible instead of hidden.
          <br>- functions to show the poems on click of the title's button, which are based on the <span id="b">.innerHTML</span> method, in order to replace the HTML div containing the poems, to the right of the Metadata Table. Basically, the text of the poem is inserted in the HTML section. The same method is used to display the poem in the second language and the css proportions allow to visulize the texts one next to the other.
          <br>- functions to highlight words and expressions in the poems, related to the chosen classes, allowing to highlight all the classes contemporarily and to remove the highlight associated to a class when this latter is clicked again while active. Such functions find the elements by their class names and change their background-color.
          <br>- flags to control if the highlight functions are active, and if they are, they stay active even when other functions are called, such as the ones for showing and hiding the second language of the poems: a flag is set true when the corresponding highlighting function is called and set false when the function to remove the corresponding highlight is called.

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo">Typographical styles</h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The document "History of Layout Design and Modern Newspaper & Magazines," accessible <a href=" http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2012/04/modern-newspaper-magazine-layouts.html">here</a>, provided a comprehensive overview of the evolution of layout design and typography styles across different historical periods. Our aim was to encapsulate the essence and artistic influences of these historical styles. This involved carefully considering aspects like page layout, space utilization, color palettes, character aesthetics, and pagination. We then modernized these elements to seamlessly adapt to contemporary digital media, ensuring an optimal user experience for both scrolling and pagination formats.

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo"><i>Bembo</i></h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The inspiration starts directly from the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bembo">Bembo</a> font and its historical significance. In fact, it is a font with a rich history dating back to the Renaissance, it's a timeless piece of typography history. Its origins can be traced to the late 15th century, when <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Griffo">Francesco Griffo</a> designed a Roman typeface for Venetian printer <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Manuzio">Aldus Manutius</a>. <br>
          This style known as <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldina">"Aldine roman"</a>, is the basis for the Bembo font we use today. Named after its debut in a 1496 book named <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Aetna">"De Aetna"</a> by <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Bembo">Pietro Bembo</a><br>
          In terms of layout, the choice is a simple and classical arrangement. Following the concept of envisioning the website as the structure of a book cover, both the header and footer contribute to a sense of continuity, as they share the same color, which is red. The site's background features a distressed paper image, while all the images throughout the site are presented in black and white.

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo"><i>Deco</i></h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The second theme is focused on recreating the essence of the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_déco">Art Déco</a>  movement, which was a prominent design movement of the early 20th century. It is characterized by its bold geometric shapes, sleek lines, and a focus on luxury and modernity. It emerged in the 1920s and 1930s, influencing various aspects of design, including architecture, fashion, and visual arts. The style exudes a sense of opulence and sophistication, often featuring intricate patterns, metallic accents, and a balance between symmetry and asymmetry.encompassing typography, architecture, and aesthetics of that era.<br>
          Regarding fonts, some of the most iconic ones from that period have been selected. The aim is to recreate the style of a 1922 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco#/media/File:Erté_Harpers_Bazar_cover_Feb_1922.jpg">Harper's Bazaar</a> cover. For the layout, working with geometry was ideal to create an effect reminiscent of the monuments from that time, which were also decorated with flowers, that are included  in the hero image, which revocates the Harper Bazaar's cover. <br>
          Gold borders have been incorporated, the green color is predominant, while the sepia filter to the images for a nostalgic effect.

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo"><i>60sad</i></h2>
        <div class="div-immagini">
        <p class="red-bold">
          The third theme is inspired to 60s advertisement pages mixed with an hippie aesthetic. The 1960s were a time of experimental and eye catching typography, so curated fonts have been selected to  pay tribute to this dynamic era, embodying the bold and expressive spirit, with its oversized letters and playful curves.<br>
          THe color palette is a kaleidoscope of 60s and hippie influences, as well as iconic colors as syblue, yellow and brown which were predominant in the sixtiees. The layout of the elements, with large margins and the centred text is coherent with the advertisement pages of the time.<br>
          The borders are adornerd with groovy circle shapes, the use of circluar imagery is reminiscent of 60s visuals, from psychedelic album covers to peace signs.<br>

        <h2 class="section-title" id="typo"><i>Alien</i></h2>
        <p class="red-bold">
          The "Alien" theme aims to represent a futuristic typographic style that embraces the concept of communication beyond human understanding, set in approximately 2030. Futuristic fonts have been selected, in particular the font "Simbolica", which is basically non comprehensive, aims to represent a possible communication between human and other entities.<br>
          The style delves into the realm of extraterrestrial aesthetics and digital innovation, the design features a dynamic background resembling a code, creating an immersive digital environment.<br>
          The predominant colors are fluorescent green and black, while for the images a blurry filter has been used to give the feeling of uncertainty.
